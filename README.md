### Running development build
To run the frontend component in development mode, execute the following:
```bash
npm run dev
```
After transpile completes, you should see a project interface if you visit `localhost`, port `3000` or `5000` in your browser.  
Follow local console output for more details.

### Running production build
Current Svelte adapter is `adapter-node`. You can adjust `svelte.config.js` for your needs.  
To make production ready build, use:

npm run build  #wait for build to complete
```
After the build completes, you should see an output directory being created (`/build`) containing optimized version of the website.
Use it as a starting point in production environments. 

If you'd like to see a production ready bundle run:
```bash
npm run preview #preview production ready build
```
